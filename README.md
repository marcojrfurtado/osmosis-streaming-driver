## Overview

This Osmosis Driver demonstrates how to expand Brizo, and go beyond static data files. It enables it to download live data from Websocket streams. It achieves this through a proxy server, which is responsible for issuing access tokens.

## Setup

These steps show how to get this driver up and running with [Barge](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/barge). 

Due to a technical limitation, this driver does not currently work with the standard [osmosis-driver-interface](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/osmosis-driver-interface). It relies on a [forked version](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/osmosis-driver-interface). This repo includes a script to extend the Brizo container with the custom interface and patch Barge (i.e. patch_barge.sh ).

We also piggyback on Brizo's container, and start our proxy server alongside the Brizo service. By default we expose port 3580 for the proxy.

### Proxy Server Settings

If you open `./Dockerfile`, you will see a section containing the Proxy Server configuration. It resembles some of the settings used by the Provider-py service.

You may need to customize some of the following settings:
```
#ENV PROXY_SERVER_HOSTNAME='myproxyhost.com'
#ENV PROXY_SERVER_TOKEN_EXPIRATION_MIN=2
```

`PROXY_SERVER_HOSTNAME` is used for generating signed URLs. Let us assume you have a WebSocket stream pointing to 
```
wss://websocket-api-host.com/stream-1
``` 
The proxy will generate a signed URL in the format 
```
http://<HOST>:<PORT>/proxy?token=1234f654
``` 
By default, `PORT` is `3580` and `HOST` is the `eth0` IP address. For our purposes, this is most likely the IP of the Provider Docker container. This IP may not be directly available to external consumers. You can use this property to override `HOST` when generating the signed URL.

`PROXY_SERVER_TOKEN_EXPIRATION_MIN` is also involved in the process of generating signed URLs. It determines how long should a token be valid. By default this value is 2 minutes.

Other settings, related to timeout, default port and number of workers, may also be overriden. However, it is recommended that you leave them at their default values

## Install

Unless you want to compile from source, you can just use Pip

```bash
pip3 install osmosis-streaming-driver
```

You also need to configure the Osmosis interface to start using by creating a configuration file, for example `~/.osmosis.json`. Paste the following content inside the file:

```json
{
    "wss://": "streaming"
}
```

And append the following line to your environment setup file (e.g. `~/.bashrc`):
```bash
export OSMOSIS_PLUGIN_MAP="$HOME/.osmosis.json"
```

Once you reload your terminal, you can instantiate it such as:

```python
from osmosis_driver_interface.osmosis import Osmosis
url = "wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws/bnbbtc@depth"
osm = Osmosis(url)  # the proper osmosis driver is loaded automatically to match the url

# Resolve the url
download_url = osm.data_plugin.generate_url(url)
```

## Code Style

Information about our Python code style is documented in the [python-developer-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-developer-guide.md)
and the [python-style-guide](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/dev-ocean/blob/master/doc/development/python-style-guide.md).

## Testing

Automatic tests are setup via Travis, executing `tox`.
Our tests use the pytest framework.

## Integration

This driver interface also includes integration tests, based on the [squid-js](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/squid-js) setup.

Please refer to the [Integration README](integration/README.md) for instructions on how to run this test and requirements.

## New Version

The `bumpversion.sh` script helps to bump the project version. You can execute the script using as first argument {major|minor|patch} to bump accordingly the version.
